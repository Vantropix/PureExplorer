# PureExplorer
__A *later to be* Free Open Source File Explorer for Windows, Linux, *maybe* Mac?__

## Context

Currently only for fun, I am one girl making something in my freetime, feel free to tell me about anything i could be doing better or if there's something wrong.

My intention is to keep all code in rust, my reasoning for this is possibly irrational but i feel every explorer being made in C or C# might be a mistake. My reason for using rust is basically to try to make something that isn't already out there. if you want something in C use the basic windows explorer, Q-Dir or One Commander.

## Thoughts 5/23/2024
I have no commitment to this project yet, it is a simple idea with design elements which i want to exist. I have never used rust before but from what i've gathered it seems like a good alternative to C/C# like other file explorers before this one has done.
I have minimal coding experience for languages like rust, most similar might be some basic c++, nonetheless i still think i should be able to at least make a basic browser.

**Features i should add as of now**
- view a folder
- Be able to open a file
- open into a different folder
- Right click to open with a different program
- Right click to rename a file
- Right click to view properties of a file
